Subject: Re: HIPAA CSP Vulnerability Reports Access

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your request.

Please note that the vulnerability scan reports are automatically emailed to all Azure Databricks workspace administrators.

At this time, we’re unable to grant direct access or add the Information Security group to receive these reports. Access is tied to the Workspace Admin role, and assigning this role requires hands-on experience with Azure Databricks due to the elevated permissions and potential impact on the environment.

If needed, we can coordinate to share the relevant report details periodically or discuss an alternative approach that meets security requirements without assigning admin-level access.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Best regards,
Girish

Subject: Re: HIPAA CSP Vulnerability Reports Access

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your request.

As part of my initial assessment, vulnerability scan reports are automatically emailed to all Azure Databricks workspace administrators.

At this time, we’re unable to grant direct access or add the Information Security group to receive these reports. Access to these reports is tied to the Workspace Admin role, and assigning this role requires appropriate hands-on experience with Azure Databricks due to the elevated permissions and potential impact on the environment.

However, we can coordinate to share the relevant report details periodically or explore an alternative approach that satisfies security requirements without assigning admin-level access.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Best regards,

**Subject:** Re: HIPAA CSP Vulnerability Reports Access

Hi [Name],

Thank you for your request.

As part of my initial assessment, I found that the vulnerability scan reports are automatically emailed to all Azure Databricks workspace administrators.

At this point, we’re unable to grant direct access or add the Information Security group to receive these reports. Access is tied to the Workspace Admin role, and Azure Databricks Admin permissions include elevated capabilities such as:

* Managing users, groups, and service principals
* Granting and revoking workspace-level permissions
* Creating and modifying clusters and compute policies
* Managing workspace configurations and security settings
* Accessing sensitive workspace assets and configurations

Given the level of access involved, I do not believe assigning Workspace Admin-level access is appropriately aligned with the responsibilities of the Information Security group. Additionally, granting such elevated access solely to receive automated email reports could introduce unnecessary risk to the stability and security of the environment.


If needed, we can coordinate to share the relevant report details periodically or discuss an alternative approach that meets security requirements without assigning admin-level access.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

At this point, we’re unable to grant direct access or add the Information Security group to receive these reports. Access is tied to the Workspace Admin role, and Azure Databricks Admin permissions include elevated capabilities such as:

* Managing users, groups, and service principals
* Granting and revoking workspace-level permissions
* Creating and modifying clusters and compute policies
* Managing workspace configurations and security settings
* Accessing sensitive workspace assets and configurations

All these activities are related to managing the Databricks workspace and are not related to engineering operations.

Given the level of access involved, I do not believe assigning Workspace Admin-level access is appropriately aligned with the responsibilities of the Information Security group. Additionally, granting such elevated access solely to receive automated email reports does not align with the security structure.

Please let me know if you need more information on this.

Best regards,
Girish


Please confirm if I should proceed with this approach.

If there is an alternative mechanism you would prefer to explore for distributing the report without assigning Workspace Admin access, kindly let me know.
