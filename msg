Hi Team,

Over the past month, we have tested one Databricks EDW test job using a job cluster in the production environment, and the job has been running successfully.

We would now like to proceed with testing the job cluster using one of the BIA team’s jobs in production. We have identified the ABC job, as it typically takes around 30–35 minutes to run and is suitable for this validation.

Please let us know if you have any concerns or if we can schedule this test.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
